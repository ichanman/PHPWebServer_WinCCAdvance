# PHPWebServer_WinCCAdvance  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to integrate a PHP web server with a database generated by **WinCC Advanced (TIA Portal)** using its "Historical Data" logging option. The goal is to display the logged data in a formatted table and make it accessible via an HMI's web browser control.  

## Prerequisites  
1. **Microsoft SQL Server** with a database configured by TIA Portal's "Historical Data" logging feature.  
2. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to manage the database.  
3. **XAMPP** to run PHP and Apache.  
4. **Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP** for database connectivity.  
5. A working installation of **WinCC Advanced (TIA Portal)** with proper logging configured.  

---

## Deployment Instructions  

### 1. Configure Database Logging in TIA Portal  
- In your HMI project, enable the **Historical Data** option under *Data Logging*.  
- Ensure the data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database.

### 2. Install Prerequisites  
- Install **Microsoft SQL Server** and set up an accessible database.  
- Download and install **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for database administration.  
- Install **XAMPP** and start the Apache service.  
- Download and configure **Microsoft SQL Server Drivers for PHP** to enable connectivity between PHP and SQL Server.  

### 3. Clone This Repository  
Clone the repository into the XAMPP `htdocs` directory:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ichanman/PHPWebServer_WinCCAdvance.git
```

### 4. Configure PHP for SQL Server
Locate the PHP configuration file (php.ini) in your XAMPP installation directory.
Add or nable the following extensions by removing the ; at the beginning of the lines:

extension=pdo_sqlsrv
extension=sqlsrv

Restart the Apache service.

### 5. Connect the PHP Script to Your Database
Open the config.php file in the repository.
Update the database connection parameters to match your SQL Server configuration:

$serverName = "YOUR_SERVER_NAME";
$database = "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME";
$username = "YOUR_USERNAME";
$password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

### 6. Test the Web Interface
Open a browser and navigate to:

http://localhost/PHPWebServer_WinCCAdvance
Verify that the logged data is displayed in a formatted table.
Notes
Ensure your SQL Server allows remote connections if hosted on a different machine.
Test connectivity between PHP and SQL Server using a simple script before deploying the full application.
